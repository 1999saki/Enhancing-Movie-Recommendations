I found this movie to be delightfully absurd and hilarious.  Definitely not the movie for you if you don't appreciate absurdist humor.  That being said, the way the parts of the movie with the roaches are filmed is fantastic. It scratches the same part of your brain as the ""I Spy"" books, with so much attention to detail on a miniature scale.  This is an underrated gem in my opinion

This movie is truly a waste of time, money, and resources. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. It is very disgusting and it took my IQ down a few points during the almost 2 hours it took to watch the movie. Trying to base a ""cute"" love story around a guy who embraces living with the nastiest bugs in the world in one of the most populated cities and who collects urinal cakes for a living with a girl who is extremely clueless is not my idea of comedy, art, or good use of my time.

Joe's Apartment looked promising, sitting there on the Blockbuster shelf, way back in 1997.  The short film from MTV, on which it was based, seemed funny enough.  I remember renting it, taking it to a friend's house to watch, and not being able to get through a half hour of it.  It remains the only VHS rental tape of which I took back and demanded a refund.  But, hey, it's been over 25 years, maybe I'm being too hard on it.  Perhaps I was in a bad mood that night.  Maybe I'll give it another sho ...MORE

Giving it a 4 cuz I remember it being funny and good. Trying to get my fiancee who is deathly afraid of roaches to watch it so I can watch again. If it's good and it cures her of her irrational fear I'll come back and give it a 5. If she don't like it...I'll probably end up roach food.

1996. One of the last years where a rich person could be tripping balls off acid, talk to a roach, then proceed to make a movie. This should have been the director's last movie if it went to the theaters, and he or she should be known as ""That Roach Guy"" forevermore.

With perhaps his worse haircut since Hard Target, JCVD gives his best performance to date. Basketball pun after basketball pun, multiple infants put into mortal danger during gun/karate/tiger fights, a secret society of ""dead"" assassins debating about mysterious incidents involving North Korea that has nothing to do with the rest of the plot, a knife fight involving feet, this movie has it all. 10/10.

I watched this movie as a kid in 2002 and fell in love with it. Yes the scripting is poor but for me, it's more of a comedy. It is a little similar to James Cameron's Titanic (1997 aswell. Ironic) in the sense that Annie had to go and save Alex who was trapped in a burning mall while the ship was on route to disaster. Like how Rose went to go and save Jack who was also trapped in the Titanic as it was about to sink.

The film is a reasonable thriller . It has some twists and turns . It has a good music score. It does hold you until the final reel where you find out who the killer is. Stone and Baldwin are good in their respective roles. Test audiences hated the original ending which led to not only a different ending being shot but the identity of the killer changed too .The film makes less sense as a result of these changes .

Movies like this have so much potential but aren‚Äôt executed with the right characters correctly. The main guy who did everything and killed all the women wasn‚Äôt a big character and we didn‚Äôt really know him well. It would have been better if we knew him better and didn‚Äôt suspect him from the very beginning because that‚Äôs what made it obvious and gave it away.

The story of an orphaned kid and his best friend, a dragon named Elliot. Overall the story is good and kept me engaged throughout. I remember watching this movie on repeat when I was little. The acting is mediocre at best, with the exception of Mickey Rooney who does an amazing job as usual. The villain actors also did a good job playing over the top villains. The special effects don‚Äôt hold up to today‚Äôs standards. I know that is tough when comparing a movie from the 70‚Äôs, but Elliot is animated ...MORE

While not entirely uninteresting, this Martin Lawrence vehicle is extremely uneven as it doesn‚Äôt seem to know if it wants to be a romantic comedy with urban overtones or a nerve-wracking FATAL ATTRACTION esque suspense-thriller. When it leans too jarringly close to the latter (especially during its intensely grim finale), it largely hinders its brighter moments, making it an unfocused misfire. The likable cast, however, makes it watchable.

Story: 4/5. This is one of those linear growth stories where you follow a band of brothers (non-literal) through one very important day in their lives. This leads to the development of the story being quite gradual and aided by careful attention to detail. This film does that really well, managing to make most of its screen time pivotal to the story. It comes with the territory that certain segments will come off as just 'hanging with the boys' and it seems to at points until the eventual payoff ...MORE

The best things here are the dialogue and the photography, which are amazing.
But many times while the movie was playing I felt that many dialogue scenes or even a whole scene doesn't actually bring much to the theme of the movie, so it felt, not specifically unnecessary, but just confusing.

It's wickedly witty and very sophisticated - which means in todays language that some people just won't get it. Based on a real life incident and a brilliant award winning play, this comes to the screen with great deal of the dialogue intact. So at times it feels stagey. But somehow that works here. Great performances by everyone, this is for grown ups who have a bit of life experience under their belts.

Six degrees of separation is a movie to understand bout oneself as humans! 

I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who wants deep understanding on interacting with humans around!!!!

This is one of those movies that Hollywood likes to pretend that is so sophisticated, if you don't understand it you're a rube. Actually, it's completely silly. The plot. Some city white folks that love  pontificating about nothing allow some guy to con them while he feeds them word salad. Don't know the rest,  I quit watching. I would suggest you don't even start.

I should probably give this film another star, but this film creeped me out so much when I first saw it, that I find it hard to say I enjoyed it. The end of the second act is so graphic and disturbing, and the final act so relentlessly bleak, that it's rather harrowing. This is jet black humor, and it's not for everyone.

This movie really should've been animated...it would've suited its cheesiness better. It's...really not good. Sure, a bit fun, and Tank Girl says some things that made me laugh, but the novelties of the movie wear thin.

An absolutely fun-filled, action-packed film from the golden age of Hollywood, with wonderful performances by Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell, each of whom left us too soon.  And yet again, Basil Rathbone demonstrates his enormous flexibility, playing the hero or villain equally and  exceptionally well.  One to be treasured, and likely the progenitor of the superheroes of comics and film that followed!

Maybe not a stand out of 80s teen angst movies, but definitely worth the watch. Stoltz is a serious lover of art that has his eyes set on the girl out of his league, when its the tom boy that he really loves.

It's good to remember how bad the movies were in the 1950's. This movie had pretty good actors struggling against an inane and improbable script. You can just imagine the front office demanding that the script do a sudden 180 degree turn with a sudden ""happy"" ending. 
However, it is fun to see a picture I probably first saw on late night tv many years ago. Also, it's fun to get a glimpse of Paris as it looked in 1954, just about 9 years after WWII.

Visually, it's a beautiful film. And Van Johnson steals every scene he's in. But the women, Liz Taylor and Donna Reed, are flat. So is Zsa Zsa Gabor. And other than cafes, I fail to see the allure of Paris in the Fifties. I am also disappointed that Van and Liz had a lovely little girl but basically left her to go partying at night. Nothing here other than beautiful people. Fluff. Predictable script. Even the death scene has Liz in full makeup.

I am a cinema buff who LOVES this film version of A Farewell to Arms and have viewed it numerous times, having also read the Ernest Hemingway novel on which the film is based.  The lyric beauty of this 1932 film far surpasses that of a later, somewhat clunky re-make (1958).  If I'm remembering correctly, I believe the cinematographer of this film was Lee Garmes, whom I met in person at the Pacific Film Archive in 1977 at UC Berkeley.

One of the Greatest Psychological Horror Movies of all Time. 

The plot revolves around a nanny who suspects the children, that she is taking care of, to be possessed.

The greatness of the movie lies in its approach. It plays with the audience's insecurities and uncertainties till the very end.  Finally it leaves us to interpret the grisly end to the movie which will haunt you forever.

Ernest Hemingway's story is an epic struggle between man and nature. Spencer Tracy is outstanding as the poor, old fisherman who has ambition
to catch and deliver a large fish to the fish market. God grants his desire,
but also places obstacles in his path: sharks. The fisherman battles the
sharks, but each shark takes a bite out of the marlin. Thus defeated, the
fisherman returns empty-handed. One of Spencer Tracy's greatest roles.

Pain so severe physically and mentally can be overcome if the will is strong enough.Does the end justify the means? for the old man, it does. The fish is the challenge that he meets and defeats. Is it clear that we can see the lesson of life here?Definitely! Endure whatever we face and win the battle through all the pain. We must---to survive!

It was daring to feel at home there, Adding fishes, managing stuff, sticking young pic of her on mirror and meeting him on daily basis.

I feel they must meet on that date night.

Finding nearly expired pineapple canes in store was also eccentric streak.

They need a doctor.

This movie is an excellent lesson on the struggles and realities of change , love and life itself. The soundtrack of this movie alone alludes to how life changes in a matter of moments and the overarching lesson that can be derived from this movie is that change can be good, even though we might be afraid of it at first. If you ever watch this movie, PLEASE pay attention to it completely.

Solid 4/5. 
Simple plot of love, loss and memories intertwined together in a fairy tale of a story. Chungking Express doesn't teach about life, the movie itself is life. A great watch with an abhorrent direction and cinematography with exceptional use of dialogues and still frames.

Love the melancholic vibe of this film. There isn‚Äôt really a beginning, middle and end for the characters, it‚Äôs more a glimpse at their situations. If you are into films for entertainment then it might bore you. But if you are a cinema geek or you like interesting stories then it‚Äôs a must watch!

The movie consists of two separate stories that are only loosely connected and the 1st part was so boring and unnecessary, that's why most people was just talking about Faye Wong in 2nd part. 

Due to this short runtime on the 2nd part and style over substance nature of the director, make it shallow in character development.

And yes all my 3 stars go for just Faye Wong's character.

A very corny movie.  The alleged murder weapon was obtained without a warrant and would seem to be inadmissible.  The DA is quick to take up with a girlfriend when his wife left without taking the children and supposedly only for a short time.  Factual, who knows.

The DA, DeLaughter, was later convicted on bribery charges in connection with another case and served time in Federal prison.  This casts a shadow on the validity of the Evers trial.

Although it was touching to see his family participated in the film.  I think I'll find out more about Mr Evers by watching some youtube documentaries instead.

A well-acted and researched film showing the struggle of the South to come to terms with the assasination of Medgar Evers, 30 years after his death.  I am sorry that I didn't see the movie when it first came out, though I have known the name, Medgar Evers, for many years.  It is a part of our racial history as a country that we must share with our children.

Baldwin's not the most convincing as the DA for the state - but James Woods plays the white supremacist deftly. Based on the true story of a race crime, it's a heavy subject that Baldwin's role doesn't carry.

This movie, now more than 25 years old, still hits so many great notes. The central relationship builds very sweetly and believably. A mostly strong cast led by the the two boys and the mother form a tender center. Life is not easy for any of these characters, but they manage to find some joy and acceptance through their mutual love. Still very few movies out there with such positive images.

A love story to match any! A Beautiful Thing has every quality a true romance film should have. A couple I care very much about. The forces working to keep them apart and finally triumph. If your looking to reaffirm feeling for love this is the film. Released in 1996 it is still relavent and important in 2020. A must see film, not just for gay men...but hey if you are a gay man...all the better.

The lives of four people in Reno happen to become intertwined in a very unusual but interesting way. This film is well written, well acted and has a great cast with Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow and Samuel L. Jackson. An excellent and very entertaining film. Highly recommended!

I must have watched a different film to most other reviewers...

I really like most of PTA's movies but this, it's the definition of pointless, boring, bland, vanilla. 
None of it is particularly convincing. Meaning it's a very flimsy story. That in turn leads to weak acting. Yes, Philip Baker Hall tries to do a good job, tries to emanate some semblance of style. But it just doesn't work. 
Same goes for the other characters/actors.
Essentially it's a silly narrative built on a foundation that's  ...MORE

A rather dark Anderson film with great actors who come together in a strange way. Prostitute doesn't get paid, they kidnap the john and it's on. Some pasts come into play , And the plot twists and turns as you guess how it will end.I think a 3 out of 5  is a good rating.I gave it a 4 for the great actors.

Paul Thomas Anderson's debut is hell of a bore!

It's a Tarantino movie with no charm and a Scorcese rip-off at times. 

The plot is about a man who has nothing to do but stick his nose in everyone's life so that he gets dragged around by their neediness.

If you want to spend time watching PTA's filmography you can easily skip his debut.

A classic of its era and stands the test of time. Roeg was a maverick highly thoughtful director who looked into the  human condition, childhood lost and life with X ray vision. Slow moving cinema with a wonderful regard for nature, life and existence. Plus some astute insight into the Aboriginal ways. Bizarre begining as the father suddenly tries to shoot his children but fails, then shoots himself. The children seem to react as if this is normal. Bar for this flaw 5 stars!

Iconic film, with a well-made gray scale. It was difficult for me to understand that it is a science fiction film, which would have been better through the scenery but I feel that it fails to close in that area.
Aesthetically wonderful, with the Parisian essence through Anna's performance. The locations feel quite modern, decadent and you can imagine that you are in a dystopian future.

Editing my previous review.

If I had not read the book beforehand, I probably would have given it a better rating. The review here that says the last 20 minutes is the only entertaining part is right. If it was a straight to tv release in the early 2000s, probably would have been a hit on the SciFi channel.

For book readers: the characters are out of whack, and Pendergast is missing entirely. Woof. Might be a fun 8 episode show for the 2020‚Äôs with the right team behind it; but currently it‚Äôs t ...MORE

Great monster, ridiculous premise.  Native American peoples are usually hospitable; they wouldn't slip poison to a guest.  Of course, drinking a soup of genetic samples can't turn you into a chaemera.

Call me ghoulish, but I was looking for a spray of arterial blood when the monster bites someone's head off.  The movie is already an R, so nothing to lose.  Hacksaw Ridge was way bloodier than The Relic.

It's what it is... a glorified 'B' movie, with a budget!
Old school movie making at its best.
Tom Sizemore is a class act and supporting cast, with the exception ot the 'Edna Mode' lookalike, are an example of (get the right ones in).
One of my favourite films, I have to say.

I loved the movie.  I would rather watch monster movies than slasher porn.  Great cast and the creature was terrifying.  I even visited the Field Museum in Chicago because of this movie.  Action pact and smart.  We need more scary flicks like this.  If you liked the Relic, check out Prophecy-the monster movie and watch them in the dark.

A revenge monster film where superstition and the real world collide and produce gruesome scenes. The premise is chilling:  Anthropologist John Whitney seeks revenge against colleagues who trivialize his research by consuming mutant/transforming viral plants in the Amazon that turn him into a hideous hybrid. Penelope Ann Miller is great as the headstrong scientist who kills the beast and offsets Sizemore‚Äôs overtly paternalistic attitude

One of my favorite films of all time. I was fortunate to watch it on the original grainy film in the early 80s.  Eery, supernatural, yet very personal. Looked it up while listening to a report today on the crazy landscape around Chernobyl. Tarkovsky was prescient, drawing the canvas of a dystopian future of industrial decay.  Considering  he did this under the close scrutiny of the Soviet censors, it's almost miraculous the deep symbolism, human emotion he employs to evoke critical thinking.

This ids probably one of my favourite telling of the story of Siddhartha as he transcends from Earthly Prince to an Enlightened Buddha, as told to a young child who may himself be an enlightened One.

The only way Fresh can save himself and his sister is by playing chess with the monsters aka drug dealers and kingpins.

This film never gets old and message behind it is still relevant in Today's society. The best way to explain this classic is like Goodfellas, but on a very dark and realistic way.

Independent film that I discovered during my American independent film phase in my early 20's when I discovered that movies don't have to blow things up or have talking monkeys in them to be good. Not that planet of the Apes isn't a great film too.

It's about a rather taboo topic. But it's far funnier and poignant than it has a right to be.

A brilliant if icky and hard to watch debut - by an original American filmmaker whose unflinching daring to delve into any topic should serve as a beacon of courage to any artist in these claustrophobic and uber-conformist times we live in... D.O. Russell is - like Clapton on guitar or Bill Evans on Piano or...that original voice - always worth the effort.

This movie is a favorite of mine. First there is Rosalind Russell. It is impossible to see her as supporting cast because she creates a character that rules the day. Paulette Goddard seems like she had been there before and is delicious. With all the tremendous surrounding staff, Norma Shearer manages a brilliant performance that stands times test. The fact that , for the most part, no men , are used and the creative way it was shot & you see a film way be f ore it's time.

This fiasco of a kid's movie during my childhood sucks with cliched ape business üêµ and  Jason Alexander along with the other actors I've also knew before (Except Paul Ruebens from the Pee-wee series) in this one were unfunny. At least Sam the orangutan who played Dunston was adorable and funny!

Loved the movie and have seen many, many and even more times! Also liked ""Mo Money"" with Keenan`s brother Damon. Also liked Keenan in ""The Glimmer Man"". I put a little more stock in Keenan than in any of his brothers. Any success or net worth they might have can be attributed to the leadership of older brother Keenan. One might say that without older brother Keenan there wouldn`t be ""Mo Money"" and that would be ""A Low Down Dirty Shame""!

Old westerns, modern westerns, comedy westerns, spaghetti westerns...  in a world chock-full of gunslinger showdown or cattle rancher movies, The Cowboy Way stands alone as a genre defining film. 

The Cowboy Way is a thoroughly enjoyable action comedy, that pits two polar opposite friends and rodeo rivals, together on a cross country journey, to find their longtime friend and employee and his new immigrant daughter, while at the same time, avoiding the clutches of the human trafficking mob.

Got to watch it! The low rating by the establishment should tell you all you need to know. This in a good hearted comedy that touches on reality verses what the social justice warriors want you to think. Illegal immigration is real! It is a multi-million, if not billion dollar business encouraged by the political establishment. Country folks like myself tend to give the shirt off there back to help other when we can. God, family, friends and Country are not bad words!

Average sequence that is generally remembered more for the Bon Jovi soundtrack than for its plot.

But the premise is really interesting because it was based on real events. There was indeed a William Henry Roberts who attracted press attention in the late 1940s and 1950s by claiming to be the famous outlaw Billy the Kid. He asked lawyer William V. Morrison for help in obtaining the full pardon he said was promised by New Mexico Governor Lew Wallace in 1879.

A bad actor who is similar to our Lampi√£o. Who was also persecuted. And here he and his gang are running away from the sheriff who is chasing them and also from a colonel who hired a criminal hunter. And so the film unfolds. Unfortunately, one by one the gang is killed. Until the end there is Billy left. A film tha ...MORE

Beautiful film, three stories that are linked in a circular way, about a region (Macedonia) whose war has only reached us through hearsay. Safety pin.

I saw this movie many years ago, as I have always been fascinated with the MƒÅori people and their customs. 

This movie is a Fantastic, yet heartbreaking film, that depicts how domestic violence and addiction can impact a family, no matter what culture you are from. I have fro say that this movie has always stuck with me and as difficult as the subject matter is, it is a worthy watch. The actors are amazing as well and it‚Äôs a movie you won‚Äôt forget. 

I really would like to see it again.

Very hard to watch movie. There are a few scenes of reality that may haunt the average viewer. It's not for the faint of heart, but such an incredible movie that embraces a culture that needs to be preserved. This is one I'll probably never watch again, but it will always stick with me. I paid $5 on Vudu for HD & it has great picture & sound quality.

Unfortunately, the author took one pathological family and created a very unhealthy story saying: ""Once we're warriors, but now we're alcoholics, rapists, worse than animals.""

It is a very bad image. 
As a warrior with body size like the main villain in the movie, I can say that behaviour like his would be unacceptable. I was raised in a country with a 33% unemployment rate. 

No man will allow another man to use violence against the weaker.

Brilliant, brilliant movie. Have seen it a few times and it's definitely hard to watch but at the same time it's real, it's raw and authentic to what happens in peoples lives. This movie crosses on so many stories and the actors and actresses all did a wonderful job in portraying the movie. Some people won't be able to watch it again but everyone should at least watch it once in there lifetime.

Anyhow, I also like the performances of Jack Benny, Robert Stack, Lionel Atwill, Felix Bressart, Tom Dugan, Charles Halton, Halliwell Hobbes, Miles Mander and Sig Ruman.  In conclusion, this classic version is much better than the 1983 remake.

Nicholas Cage was awesome in this movie of many upcoming stars, you see Ving Rhames, Sam Jackson, Micheal Rappaport and a couple more including David Caruso.  Mr. Caruso has something great but it is sad that he was at the beginning of his type-casting and this part didn't fit him completely.  I love CSI: Miami and Mad Dog and Glory and he is part of that love.

Denzel W. as Parker Barnes  in a fierce fracas with the former  ""on and offline"". If that didn't seem interesting to you then maybe if you're a fan of The Matrix film series you ought to give this film a peek. That lady in red and some scenes in ""the program"" manifest unambiguous influences to the Wachowski's futuristic phenomenal hit.

Lange's Best Actress win for this movie has not aged well for many of the movie reviewers and Oscar pundits I read and listen to regularly.

I first watched Assassins for the first time in 1998 on sky movies and absolutely enjoyed it unfortunately I missed out on taping on my VHS but due to the movies showing on repeat I recorded it on my 2nd viewing.

Amazing Flick, Banderas at its insanely best!

I ain't gonna waste your time in the name of directors, actors and or the plot, you have IMDB for that. Lets cut down the chase and focus on what I think of this movie.

Plot is intricate, and deserves every minute of your attention. Some terms and jargons introdduced could be complicated to understand.

It's an awesome action movie with a great storyline and a surprising end. The setting is great for the story and both Banderas and Stalone entered the skin of the characters. Banderas' role as a constantly agitated and insane was difficult and he was fantastic! And by Stalone, I particularly liked the scene in which he discovers that Nicolai - an agent he thought he killed 15 years before and felt guilty for - was, actually, very much alive. This scene felt so, so real. Personally, I loved the m ...MORE

It's Action Legend Sylvester Stallone vs Antonio Banderes in ""Assassins"".  It's fair to say the movie underperformed at the Box Office. Although there's a lot of fun to be had. Stallone plays an Assassin coming to the end of his career. He's become tired of the life he's been living and is haunted by demon's from his past. Unfortunately he's about to become the target of Antonio Banderes who wants to be the No1 Assassin and believes to do that he must kill Stallone's character. The movie has a m ...MORE

Doesn't deserve the harsh criticism from the critics. 16% on rotten tomatoes?? This movie deserves minimum 3 stars, and 60-65% on Rotten Tomatoes. I know plenty of not-so-good movies with over 50-60% mark on Rotten Tomatoes. Is it the best action movie? No, but it's decent and entertaining (despite its flaws). I thought all actors were great, Stallone, Banderas and Moore deliver great performances. Plot has few issues but the movie still redeems itself with its energy.

This film is probably one of the best Disney films ever created, especially with a Walt Disney Original character. Massive respect for the Director, because right after, he created Tarzan, and that was a masterpiece. Unforgettable this film was, How time flies.

Honestly, a childhood favorite that still touches today. With an amazing soundtrack, witty writing, and wonderful performances an emotional, realistic, and charming coming-of-age tale from one of Disney's most unlikely characters. It's funny, but also very endearing with surprising valuable grown-up messages amongst classic Disney hijinks. Utter bliss to watch, over and over.

This is the movie you watch on the last week of school. It is perfect for the Summer time. I've loved this movie for almost 7 years now since I watched it. It is an expertly crafted film. It is truly a masterpiece. And Powerline is an absolute star in this movie. The music by Powerline is so good and really steals the show if you ask me.

One Of My Favorite Animated Disney Features Not Produced By Walt Disney Animation Studios, Back then, Walt Disney Feature Animation.

But Done By Disney MovieToons now, Disneytoon Studios or was, Until it's Closure In Summer 2018.

But yeah i Liked the Story with Goofy & Max going across the Country & the Relationship between Father & Son was Fun to Watch :)

So yeah i would Recommend Watching it.

The truth was told early in the movie, but they're not listening. And at one point Goofy didn't listen to the RIGHT people. And we all go through the teenage and pre-teenage years of white lies to people. Especially to people we like and love. It happens. It's a lesson. Max wants to impress Roxanne.

A textbook rendering of alcoholism and its impact upon all of the family members.  Critics who gave lukewarm reviews to this film were either uncomfortable with the topic, or simply do not have an understanding of addiction.

Hats off to the screen writers, as well as to Ryan and Garcia.  They portray the true nature of intimacy and the difficulty in trying to attain it.

It was a pretty good movie. Denis Leary added excellent dark humor with a chilling twist into it. The acting was very good as was the action. The film also had a good moral to it. That is whenever you get involved with someone who has questionable morals who tries to take shortcuts in life and tries to sweep things under the rug the way Jeremy Piven's character did in this film, you may wind up in sticky situation that you may never get out of.

Overrated 90s ""coming of age"" movie with an overweight nerd who, of course, lusts for the cute blonde cheerleader and is victimized by bullies (though he ALWAYS manages to land a well-timed punch on a bully's nose). Yawn. Cliche follows cliche. Even Tobey Maguire's ""Spiderman"" had more realistic high school scenes. I gave up halfway. So fake, only relatable to those who look like the film's star.

The good features An Awfully Big Adventure has are the screenplay and the cast lineup. The plot doesn't have a lack of diversity or intrigue, per se, but it is a very eventful film. Any fan of Alan Rickman who has not seen this movie is surely missing out. 

We start off the production with Stella (Georgina Cates), a 16-year-old girl, who lives in Liverpool with her aunt and uncle. She doesn't know much about her parents, however, we do see her frequently making calls in phone booths to talk wit ...MORE

In my opinion this film throws light on the behaviour of people who have an authority over others or is someone's superior. How such a person can hurt others by using their authority to further their own agenda, satisfy their ego. And it also tells us the somewhat cruel story of how small the world is, where a father has sexual relations with his own daughter without him knowing until it's too late, it only leaves us thinking what he must be thinking how that must have affected him knowing such  ...MORE

I don't recall watching Under Siege 2 before prior to my recent Blu-ray purchase.  I'd just finished Under Siege 1 and was unimpressed so why I would watch Under Siege 2 is beyond me but I found it to be more enjoyable surprisingly!  The story, (although still far fetched) is more sensible in how it plays out and the main bad guy, Travis Dane,has a back story that fits it.  He's crazy, but not too crazy, and no other bad guys were like him so he stood out.  The acting still wasn't fantastic but  ...MORE

Great Movie. In this movie, Casey Ryback, the ex-seal from the first movie is traveling on a train with his niece. When armed men seize the train so they can take over a Military Satellite. Casey and a Porter on the train have to save the day and prevent the bad guys from blowing up the Pentagon.
The Movie has a lot of suspense, hand to hand combat, gun battles, and a little romance.

Seeing this when I was young (in the theater) was great. Watching today (in my 50s) is a bit awkward and amusing. You start to feel sorry for a middle aged Madonna and how immature (and insecure) she is/was. She was also so desperate for attention. However, her vocals and energy on this tour was top notch. Too bad she wasn't brave enough to make more powerful (from the heart) albums the likes of LIKE A PRAYER...

I've grew up with this movie, the director chose the right thing to create.

For a critic, the lighting in some scenes need to be corrected so it looks more realistic; the tornado in scene four, looks utterly fake? But thats 100% fine to me. 

Once more, I'd like to say you should all watch this movie if you haven't already it would mean the world to me if you could take some time out of your day to watch Twister.

This movie is so amazing and I love it. It's my favorite movie ever. It helped me a lot cause i want to be a Storm Chaser when I grow up. This movie had me laughing at Dusty. He was the best character for me on the movie. I loved the MASSIVE F-5 tornado. That was really big and had some strong winds too. The guy who was trying to steal ya'll information was feeling himself way to much but I still got a good LAUGH out of it. If u haven't seen the movie, I HIGHLY recommend you to watch it.

I feel like the special effects, though they didn't exactly maintain over the years, are still adequate to get the point across.  After looking back on this, there doesn't feel like there is a lot of story here.

You can pretty much sum up the movie by saying they chase tornadoes for most of it.  There's a rom com shoved in here, which partly serves for this particular story.  There's a tech race story in there too, but i'm not entirely sure how ...MORE

In anticipation of the sequel, Twisters, I went back to watch the mid 90s original. Boy, did this movie not age well. Nor do I remember it being this bad. Maybe it was just a sign of the times, or my young age. 

Set in Oklahoma, yet clearly filmed partially in Texas with very visible Texas road signs, a separated couple of tornado chasers meet up to get the divorce moving. Instead, cheesy technology meant to disrupt tornados when they form, appears to be nearing success. Sounds good, r ...MORE

Some very nice song choices in Humans Being by Halen and etc and some terrific special effects for its time but so many of the supporting actor roles were just quite weak.

This movie does not deserve the bad rep that it has.  Epic production values, epic camera work, epic set design, epic special effects, and epic miscasting. I felt there were really only two things wrong with this movie: Geena Davis and Matthew Modine. While both are capable actors, both were too contemporary for a good old fashioned swashbuckler. With her endearingly goofy grin and his preppy presentation, Maureen O‚ÄôHara and Errol Flynn they were not.

Has a genuine and interesting anaylsis of meaning and the search for identity in a post-material world with the event of cyborgs. 
I find the story a little dense and exposition heavy, as we are thrust into a world of murkly politics and competing ministerial powers in a dystopic future.
Gorgeous portrayal of gender ambiguity in the lead protagnoist.

Google's listing is inaccurate; this one's clearly science fiction, not fantasy.

Edit: The nudity another reviewer mentioned recently is not random; it's purposeful and plot/character relevant.  But the film is rated as it is for good reason.

Based on a short story by Legendary Horror Writer Stephen King, this movie is arguably the most unjustly and unfairly overlooked of all the Stephen King stories that made it onto the big screen. The plot sees an amoral and corrupt Newspaper Report investigating a series of murders at Local Airfields, each of the victims are drained of blood. The killer seems to be flying a dark black Cesena Light Aircraft. Is he just a vicious serial killer? Or something not quite human? The movie zips along at  ...MORE

If you're fed up with movies that have a pretty much commercial endings for everyone, go watch this movie, it will leave you with a balanced feeling. At least that's how I felt about it.

Keep your rod in the proper position while fishing

The best hook sets come when you have maximum leverage, with both hands on the rod, and the rod held in the center of your mass. If you have your arms extended or otherwise off-center and a fish strikes, you can‚Äôt get leverage on your hook set and are much more likely to miss the bite.

A reasonable good comedy. Gone Fishin' is a film from 1997 about two old friends named Joe and Gus played by Joe Pesci and Danny Glover whom had already did Lethal Weapon 2 and 3 together at the time. 
As the title of the movie implies Joe and Gus go on a fishing trip to Florida but they keep running into problems including a dangerous wanted criminal. It is a film that is funny, you do not need to be a fisherman to get the jokes and I would recommend to anyone that likes to laugh.

The ending was a bit disappointing because Angelina's character ""Legs"" shouldn't have ran away from her problems but it made sense in a way. I love her and Maddie's relationship and wish they spent more time together so that Maddie would realize she's in love with Legs. There are many thing i wish thi ...MORE

I enjoyed this movie, but it is not for everyone. Some of it was pretty interesting, and parts were somewhat bizarre. The very popular actress Angelina Jolie, added a good deal to the movie's success. It could be considered a predessor of the ""MeToo"" movement. Several high school girls get revenge for a teachers sexual harassment, but then get themselves into considerable trouble.

Recommended score: 0.7/10

Robocop, as in the series of films, is like mankind's future: nosediving with robots at the helm.
As entertaining as spreading peanut butter on ones testicles & asking a saltwater crocodile to lick it off.

This movie is about four friends who rob banks. It is a portrait of how minority women are treated in our society. These women watch their lives disintegrate until there is nothing left but dispair and death. Stony's brother is killed by the police. Frankie is fired from her bank job. Elise (Tisean) is a struggling single mom and a reluctant participate.  Cleo (Queen Latifah) nailes it as the lesbian.  This movie is  clearly not for very young viewers.

Very good movie, excellent acting from Belushi, Shakur, Dennis Quaid,James Earl Jone. Lela Rochon very good performance, and shes hot. This film is well directed, excellent camera work, and lighting. And the story is very good. I can recommend this wonderful movie  to anybody liking crime movies about 2 crooked cops.  The city was unnamed, but it was filmed in Los Angeles. ""Keep your sense of humor, remain loyal, you""ll live longer"". Its available on mgm dvd.

I despised Furlong in Terminator with his sullen humourless eyes and hair hanging in front of his face.
I loved the performance of his little sister. Neeson always plays a control freak who has ‚Äúacquired

The plot is drama drama drama. All Jake had to do was report an accident. Two stars out of five.

One of the most poorly done movies I've ever seen.  When Jacob showed up,  I thought he was extremely miscast.  The fact the he impregnated a girl was not believable ...it was so poorly written that even Meryl Steep couldn't save it.  Why do they show movies that no one ever heard of that were so badly done?
Bring back movies that are beautiful and inspirational in these dire days, instead of running these bad films.

How come that the complete cast of this movie was acting so terribly bad?? It seemed to me everyone was reading his text from a dirty teleprompter. Meryl Streep played, as usual, a very annoying character. Liam Neeson acting very unconvincingly too. False sentiment all over the movie, no clear message at the end. Very bad.

There's a nostalgia to the way this 90s drama is acted out. When their son gets wrapped up in the death of a teenage girl, Streep and Neeson juggle how to save him. Kids aren't great actors, but it's a good novel turned film.

Phoebe Cates is a luminous presence in this film and displays the poise, confidence and puzzled wariness that makes her role in the film so believable.  The class climbing ambitions and affectations of those around her shows how people will believe anything if they think it serves their purposes.  Not meant to be a social document it is an enjoyable entertainment with a very good and beautifully costumed cast and makes you willing to suspend any thoughts of disbelief as events unfold.

Love this movie.its a mature realistic romantic movie. Plot knits smoothly around people who touch and shape each other's lives as in touch and go. It flows smoothly like the theme music. Everytime la fortuna is introduced to the main characters- its a stage set musically - treat for eyes and ears.
The character of tuffy and her pain  is understandable as reel characters temprary happiness. Its a good movie. Nothing/noone  is prop in the movie. Its a poetry.

This is one of the very rare instances that the movie is better than the book. The storyline is kinder and focuses on the friendships more. Whitney Houston is of course iconic in this. It was a very strong cast overall with a great director to boot. Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, Wendell Pierce etc. Forest Whitaker‚Äôs debut is his masterpiece. The performances are one for the ages. Timeless. You also cannot forget the amazing soundtrack with the likes of Aretha and Rita Flack. Additional applaus ...MORE

The scenery is spectacular.  The life is attractive to one who has been there.  The relationship between the horse and the whisper makes more sense to me than the relationship between Tom and Mom.  In Ebert's review, there is some mocking of the eye-to-eye, but, as an animal whisper in a small-time way, I know the centrality and power of that kind of communion.  Relax in a slow-paced, easy-going story of hurts and hearts healed.

This was pretty good. Predictable, but good. Kind of disappointed due to lack of true ""animal-mending"" scenes. Not to be a spoiler, but this is a bittersweet love story; the animals are simply placeholders. Good for a watch, but (if you're a thinker, first) don't be surprised if you find yourself going, ""Why didn't he (or) Why didn't they....?"" I think that's what simply ""makes"" the movie (along with animal scenes).

I saw this movie back in the theatre in the 90s and wasn't very impressed. The plot is a convoluted mess. A sexy, sultry Sharon Stone gives a halfway decent performance as a woman bent on revenge for her parents' murder at the hands of a Cuban organized crime chieftain--played with an atrocious mock accent by Rod Steiger--and hires bomb expert hit man and ex CIA agent Stallone to blow up the Cuban Mafioso's son and henchmen who actually carried out the foul misdeed.

This movie packs a punch, lots of twists and turns! 'an epic movie title for all moviegoers alike! 'Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone & Eric Roberts, goes above and beyond with their acting skills in this epic movie! 

Unfortunately, movies aren't made like this anymore!

Cat to Stallone: hey, dummy, pick me up so I can ignore you. Meow.
Any time a movie requires a bad guy, Eric Roberts gets a call. Btw: neither he nor his sister are good looking.
James Woods is probably the 11th best actor ever. You hate that guy but he sure can act. Ref: ""AGAINST ALL ODDS.""

I love this film.  I think it shows another version of Stallone that isn't quite whats expected, its not all ""muscles at dawn"" with guns on a rampage, it shows he can play a more mellow character. We see a complex person  who has real emotions, is susceptible to beauty, has compassion and deeply cares about the impact of his ""work"" on the innocent.  Add to that the fabulous sound track, how can anyone not like this film?

I came across this movie after watching Barbie on Hulu and I actually liked it. ""No Fear"" was a funny song and the characters were amazing. Though it did feel like a Disney Ripoff at least it was good. The two sequels that came after were good too.

I would agree with the majority view also that it looks a bit dated and creaky now, but at the time it seemed to be really out there in the sci-fi realm.

Nevertheless, there was still some scenes similar to the old antagonist, Kreese. I would have wished they did better on that. Although the trilogy of the karate kid is so much better than this, this is still pretty decent. If you want to see a pre-oscar, Hilary Swank ,you should definitely watch this. I 100% recommend.

On the surface, 'No Escape' is just another generic action movie set in a prison environment. An island prison from which escape is impossible? An Alcatraz by any other name... Plus the 'two faction-one nice, one evil' has overtones of Lord of the Flies. While both of the above comments are applicable, the film rises above itself. With good performances from powerful actors such as Ray Liotta and Stuart Wilson, along with a sharp script, 'No Escape' is a hidden gem, and well worth seeking out.

Oh, man. This is a roller coaster. It's all about women being insecure, to find out they had no need be. Not the men helped much, but the mothers really give their daughters hell. The only good guy was Andrew McCarthy's character. His wife brought it on herself. All he wanted was her to be free, and then she turns on him. Not cool. Technically, it was his house, not hers.

I don't know if I was just in a really good mood or not, but I actually liked Highlander III when I just caught it on TV. Christopher Lambert was, once again, pretty good as Macleod showing centuries of experience and age. Mario Van Peebles was a lot of fun as Kane. For me, the weak link of the cast was Deborah Unger, not that she's bad, but once again a love story is forced into one of these films and she mostly follows MacLeod or Kane. The sword fights are entertaining, even if it feels as if  ...MORE

After Highlander II flopped, crashed, burned, and exploded on impact in theater back in 1991 and many thought that was the end for the Highlander series. However a television show and cartoon managed to keep interest alive. So in 1994 as sort of a make-up or apology for Highlander II, Highlander III was released. While it faired slightly better than the second film that really isn‚Äôt saying much. Critics still hated the film, audiences were meh, and no one talks about Highlander III. Even the oth ...MORE

I would have to say is the best of the Highlander sequels. Granted, that is faint praise and i did find Highlander II more entertaining (for all the wrong reasons).

For a start, the reason why the main villain Kane (Mario Van Peebles) couldn't kill Macleod isn't due to bad writing but because he was stuck in  ...MORE

With the Criminal Subplot thankfully abandoned it's back to basics for this episode.

Please explain which accent Gwyneth were going for? It's not English nor American.

It's very similar to that flick, Plan 9 from Outer Space by Ed Wood.

But, I don't know... Her latest performance in the Goop Lab was exactly the same... extremely flat. I mean, she was playing herself.

How do you train for this? How do you work as a performer and manage to act in the same way since 1989? Is there a school for this type of method acting?

Interesting plot for its time as the film cleverly intertwines the two realities.
Huge let down by the both of uncharming lead actors (John Hannah and John Lynch) I've ever seen. 
So one star for the plot and another for young Gwyneth Paltrow.

Weird to see American actors try British accents, Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äôs was quite good, John Lynch‚Äôs accent kept changing.
The only thing that really annoyed me when Gwyneth Paltrow referencing Jeopardy, it would have been The Weakest Link!

Also the Gary Glitter joke I thought was very unexpected for the time it was set in!

I literally cried over this movie in class when watching it. I thought I wouldn't cry since usually I am able to keep in my tears but, something about Kevin's death just had me sobbing in class. It might've been the thought that Max just lost his best friend and that he became just extremely sad. This has been the saddest movie I've seen as it is one of the movies that really made me cry. I would do anything to go through seeing the movie in class again and just cry my eyes out again.

And why would Freak drive a car?

If I hadn't read the book first I may have found it more entertaining. I really hated how they left out so many key parts that make up the actual story, but then added more. There are some additions that I do favor a bit more, like with Tony D.'s age. Otherwise, it was a good movie, it had emotion, and most of the major events.

Such a beautiful movie. I had seen it when it was first released, back in the nineties. I remember I loved every bit of it even though it has some quite dramatic moments. So it was a joy when last week I found it on demand on Star+. A gem that had been once lost was now found again. That's precious. After watching it again, after so many years, I remembered why I loved Gary Oldman so much. Yes, he is heavenly. And he did not start in Harry Potter or Batman, please.

A good piece to watch. Based on a very interesting but questionable plot. Adultery or affairs but presented in a nice logical polite way. Gary Old man was nice but its Demi Moore whom you hardly put on 2nd. She has got acting inherently. Oh!!!! the way she gave birth her child and instantly took the child and kissed...awesome ,simply unparalleled. I always prefer to watch her love scene. So attractive and natural but no vulgar.

I love this movie because it's a period piece that plays attention to details of the time. That house!!!!! Lol. As for the actors, Gary Oldman and Demi Moore, well done. But WHO ever thought Robert Duvall could pull off his part.... His southern draw is evident through out though he tries to hide it. Worse performance of his career I think, and spoils the movie for me. But I watch it when available because of the other actors and the sets... And the clothes, and the history!

If you're into cats, you'll just adore this 1965 version of ""That Darn Cat"".

It's a pretty light-hearted triller about a cat (DC) that just so happened to run into some bank robbers and their hostage in their hideout during the cat's nightly exploration.

The cat brings back evidence of this encounter to two sisters (one of whom contacts the FBI) and the rest of the film is about trailing the cat at night to see if it'll go back to the robbers.

Starring Hayley Mills again as the female lead. This is her last film, and Dean Jones‚Äô first for Disney. The plot focuses on a cat that the FBI uses to solve a kidnapping and burglary. It started a little slow, but picked up in the second act and ended up being an entertaining movie. If you like drama/comedy or cats, I would suggest this movie.

Poverty makes life hard, but to Apu and Durga, as innocent they are, their child-like little activities bring us back to childhood nostalgia. Ray's one of the greatest works, with scenic beauty which leaves in our mind traces worth remembering. Cinematography, Plot, Characterisation everything achieved at its brilliance.

The greatest, most realistic and most beautiful portrayal of human life ever, in this world and in any other world known or unknown. Such once-in-a-millennium masterpieces are produced when great masters like Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay (Writer), Satyajit Ray (Director) and Pandit Ravi Shankar (Music) and their whole team put their efforts together.

It is able to get Oscar mustly. Thanks to Sattyajit Roy for giving us a wonderful film as a gift. I think he was the best film director and cameraman.

If there is any movie that I've ever watched to its satisfaction and admired then that is this movie. Back in olden days average men have to pay huge price for their dream to come true. Innocence and modesty had huge price. I loved the entire team's act. If we want to sit back and reflect on what we achieved and lost then this movie guides you through for sure!!!

Pather panchali(1955) delicately  illustrates how ""poverty does not always nullify love"" & how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world. This film tell us of rural life in bengal & depicted all sorts of  life style in a unique way which no other movie did before so beautifully, Apu & durga as innocent they are, their child like little activities bring us back to childhood nostalgia , it is really good movie & you can watch this movie.

It does not feel like a movie, rather a slice of life. Innocence of Apu and Dutga takes us back to our childhood. The struggle with poverty is overwhelmed by remarkable display of humanity, the sheer rerealism and and nuances of bond of love, affection and simplicity. Bow my head to one the greatest film makers of all tome. Satyajit Ray.

This is a real treat from master director and story teller Alfred Hitchcock. Filmed just one year after the outbreak of the Second World War, it is full of suspense and intrigue. I had never seen Joel McCray before but he does a great job as the title character. The supporting cast, including British film legends George Sanders and Herbert Marshall, is uniformly excellent. What a cool climax!

If it wasn't for the corny propaganda... But anyway a great little thiller with some impressive set pieces. Hitchcock didn't need an overly constructed plot to make it work, injecting his finesse and humour at every step. Current action/adventure filmmakers should take note of this fine example of escapist cinema.

Another  really good propagandist movie for a war torn world. A little silly in the romance department but an entertaining suspense movie.  Hitchcock (assisted by his brilliant wife) was a highly stylized director, a teller of short, tight stories, and one of the greats in the movie business. His early stuff in Europe was ground breaking and reworked  over and over to good effect in Hollywood in color and tinseltown stars.

I can't fathom how this is rated PG. It is beyond violent. It shows a man pull out a knife on someone, and then he stabs him over and over again. This should be PG-13. So disappointed.

I dont care how many big name actors you put in a movie, If you're going to have a French king, then at least get an actor that can fake a french accent. I couldn't concentrate because it was so distracting and it felt like I was watching a play with the lines being read by DiCaprio and Malcovich. The rest are good actors just hard to watch when they are reading their lines straight off the paper. I may be alone in my assessment but that's it!! Rest of the acting is great!!

It was an amazing movie and very creative, but I took one star off because Santa didn't have big enough muscles. His musces should be at least 20 pounds of extra weight because of how much he lifts. I would've been pleased. Overall, would watch again.

If you are looking for a great christmas movie for the holiday season, I advise you look elsewhere. The acting is an abomination, and it seems like a middle schooler wrote the script for this movie. Also, there are some racist elements and some cultural appropriation in this film. I greatly advise you to spare your eyes and not watch this movie.

This is the first time I attempt to review any work of Satyajit Ray, as I don't really know how to describe this sublime director's art. If we have a collective cinematic memory as a Bengali, Apu tearing away his manuscript or the joyous father carrying his equally ecstatic son over his shoulders are the ones imprinted for life. If you feel for some characters as a cine watcher, Apu in Apu'r Sansar has to be one. On the contrary to Panther Panchali, it ends on a happier ...MORE

Leaves no chance for us to judge the movie. All the parts of this movie are so interesting that we can't afford to miss any. Also my respect to Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, one of the gems in Bengali Literature.

I could only aspire much for Apu, although I felt that this is a good film. In the first installment of the trilogy, Apu was born poor. And in this last installment, he is still poor and destitute. I felt that Apu must have learned from his humble beginnings and become a much more productive fellow, but he has not. It is sad and heartbreaking. We the audience did not learn something useful.

It was... Interesting. I felt like they kind of backed themselves into a corner on the ending but did the best they could. I just don't know how we got to a point where Paul Rudd was not the clear victim in all this. Jennifer Aniston really led him on in some psychologically damaging ways and I felt like it wasn't addressed at all.

The whole premise was a minefield and very ballsy, so credit where credit was due. Great chemistry between Rudd and Anistan.

I watched Witness for the second time recently.  It is set in 1984 Lancaster County PA where I lived for a short time.  Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis play the two leads - John Book and Rachel.  He is a police officer who takes on the task of protecting her and her son Samuel after he witnesses a murder in a train station.  The director does a great job with pacing the movie and letting the actors communicate frequently with glances, stares, and smiles.  Book ends up living in the Amish commun ...MORE

Great movie with great acting!! It didn't need special effects to show how great this film is. Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis are great together. The chemistry alone is breathtaking and realistic. There's so much chemistry between the two that words are not needed. That's is find acting. Well done to the cast and Crew. They don't make movies like this anymore. I can't believe it's over 30 years and still as good as of it just came out in the cinema. 10 out 10.

Witness is a fantasic movie with so many components that fall into place effortlessly. The comparison between the simple lives of the Amish people and the complications of corruption in the police force sets an interesting and dramatic scene. Weir is a master of using visuals instead of filling up every second of a film with dialogue. He is able to say so much with a scene or a look. Lucas Haas is beautiful as the young boy with the huge eyes full of wonder.

War and Peace.  The violence of city cops against the idyllic peace and inner strength of the rural Amish.   What was witnessed?  The woman's young son witnessed a murder by a corrupt cop.  What we witnessed were love scenes (between Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis) that make you ache for love.  Amazing how the portrayal of this Amish mother would make her so desirable.  Please let their love happen.  But their worlds could not be reconciled and in the end, they both knew they had to part.

One of the best - and directed by Peter Weir (The Picnic at Hanging Rock) with music by the wonderful Maurice Jarre, who knows his Bach. FIrst-rate performance by Harrison Ford and several cows. The Lancaster, Pa landscape is lovely.  And most of  it is not set in a city. What a relief.

I'm a big Harrison Ford fan. And a Peter weir fan. Again, he employs the old keeping the intimacy in a relationship hidden technique. I prefer that. And at the same time he shows a very steamy male/female encounter. The movie has the adventure stuff too. Something for everyone. I often tell Amish people who I know don't see movies how well this director depicts their lifestyle.

While not as mean-spirited, crude or juvenile as most of the films he appears in, SENSELESS still doesn‚Äôt do much to elevate Marlon Wayans to feature film stardom, and the film on the whole is only occasionally funny but most of the time stilted and somewhat repetitious (although seeing David Spade in a Dimension Films release is actually quite refreshing and unusual).

The extra star is strictly for production. Obviously influenced by the cinematography of Fassbinder's THIRD GENERATION, NOWHERE dazzles and dazes for about a half-hour after which the shock, fancy colors  , sex toys etc. wear thinner than miso soup./ Film at this point screams for a co-writer but there aint one so it just goes, well, NOWHERE. I expect more from the fellow who gave us The Living End and Mysterious Skin which both had classic story lines, not just Lynchian cheap thrills.

Parents be warned, the children remove their clothes and the boy speaks of seeing many naked women on the internet so it is OK to look on the girl.  There is a scene in a darkened room with them together and comments are made. It certainly can teach sensual behavior to children as being right. Of course, adults all planned this, and we know pornography for children is being placed in schools and libraries. We must walk as wise people, not foolish.

I first watched this when I was a kid! I watched again today I love it! The Olsen twins truly were amazing and will always be classic and remembered for their amazing acting abilities. But- as an adult it feels like a missing plot hole that we don't figure out how these two were separated at birth. Two people can't be this identical without sharing DNA plus same age and everything. I wish they would have added that into the movie.

It‚Äôs just like the Parent Trap, same plot and same type of characters, except this movie is actually played by real twins (Marykate and Ashley) unlike the Parent Trap which was played by the same person (Lindsay Lohan).

Strangely I've never seen this until today 26th July 2022. Strange because Pather Panchali is in my top 3 films. Saw it first time maybe 46 years ago.  A dozen times since perhaps. Satyait Ray and Louis Bunuel are my favourite directors. This was good of coarse, but not great. Never reached the depth of quality and poignancy of the 1st film. However, such an enjoyment and a treat for me to finally catch it. Slow moving, harmonious art on celluloid. Now to find the final part 3.

Aparajito, a 1956 Indian Bengali-language drama film written and directed by Satyajit Ray, and is the second part of ""The Apu Trilogy"". It's adapted from the first half of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's novel Aparajito. It starts off where the previous film Pather Panchali (1955) ended, with Apu's family moving to Varanasi, and chronicles Apu's life from childhood to adolescence in college.

It is a film that portrays a time that should be remembered by society in general, namely the beginning of the industrial era.

It shows how factory workers at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries - who would be called proletarians by Marx - were exploited to sub-human levels in factories.

Children as young as 5 years old working collecting scraps of cotton and reusable fabric under the looms - even at night - dying, crushed by the machines, after falling asleep under them from exhaustion.

Truly Incredible, Daens - A Cry of Justice is a Drama nominated for an Oscar for best foreign film in 1993. It shows a Belgian priest, called Adolf Daens, he was fighting for workers' rights in his country, the weaving mills in his country decided to replace workers by women and children. A very important film to compare the views of great sociologists, a beautiful story that certainly makes you reflect on these sad things that man causes in society.

As an audience who has seen some of his works in Hollywood, I never thought I would this film this much. 

Despite the film has a lagging first half with some adrenaline rushed action sequences, the second half is just a masterpiece.

Although a classic, it has its own flaws. I watched this in 2022, but I'm sure in 1992 it was pretty innovative and novel.

Surely, you can't go guns blazing in a garage full of metallic objects just shooting like the bullets aren't going to reflect back off the surfaces, or receiving a shotgun shot to the back and proceeding to function normally. However, it still beats what Hollywood makes nowadays, so I'd recommend it even if it's only for the sake of the two lead actors.

its strange that this is STILL one of the best pure-action films ever made, and its over twenty years old.
one of the main reasons i think that this is still a standout film is that all of the effects are practical [i think] rather than CGI which makes everything going on on-screen so much more life-like with the stunt men really working for their paychecks

Terrible movie with terrible acting. I can't believe this got so many positive reviews. I had an hour to kill and it was dreadfully boring. The female main character was annoying and cringey, laughing like a nutcase during scenes that it wouldn't make sense to laugh. The Chinese people were only used in the movie to come in like gangbusters and beat up the skinheads when threatened. There are no lessons learned in this movie, and you feel nothing toward any ""victims"". The skinheads are portrayed ...MORE

One of the things I find fascinating about movies is how it can sometimes surprise you. This is one of those movies I never would give the time of day but since it‚Äôs Covid2020, I just happen to chance upon it and accidentally let it run in the background while working at home.  It was on after a movie I was somewhat watching on Cinemax.

Good movie with a very niche subject matter.  Good actors and acting.  Good script.  Decent flow.  And a subtle way of shocking you.... just like lifeüòè.

rather inaccurate depiction of an ultraorthodox society in NY. As acted on scene, clearly little resemblance of Hassidic lifestyle. Marital problems and failings as depicted are ostentatiously and somewhat insultingly out of line with an official orthodox instruction. The main protagonist is easy to feel for, but at a heavy price of misrepresentation and distortions of an ultraorthodox lifestyle and an approach to marriage

The little rich guy has more than they guess up his sleeve and turns the tables on them, and neatly. As an aside this movie has an abfab female cast. They none of them have much of a part (the three men are front and center) but they are high wattage: Ellen Burstyn, Roseanna Arquette and Rene√© Zellweger. Told ya.

When I first saw the trailer of this I thought it was going to be horrible. But this movie is actually very good. It has a good story line, great acting and tugs at your heart a bit. Natalie Desselle Reid really stole this movie (no disrespect meant to Halle Berry.) She was absolutely hysterical and it seems like that was her first film because she is billed as ""Introducing Natalie Desselle Reid.""  RIP :(

A stylish gangster movie with plenty of gun action, memorable moments, and cinematography that does justice to its setting.

An underrated gangster classic. It is up there with the very
best of the genre but remains relatively unknown to the
general public at large. Chris Walken as Frank White is at
his icy best. Imagine Dracula returning to 20th Century
New York as a crime lord. Indeed the opening credits of Frank
been driven through a rotting city isn't that far removed from
Chris Lee as the ancient vampire riding through Transylvania.

It speaks volumes that the rap community gave the film'

While Goodfellas had made me think I highly dislike gangster movies, this movie made me realize that the genre can be quit likable. These two movies came out the same year and share the same genre so I can't stop comparing them. my unpopular opinion is that King of New York is much superior to Goodfellas in every way.

Who said that being the king was the easiest thing in the world? Frank White is released from prison with plans to take back his empire and use it for the right causes. However, rival mafia gangs and the police department go to extreme lengths to stop Frank and his rise to power. Guns blaze and bodies drop, with Frank desperately running out of options and his enemies closing in. No one escapes unscathed in this grim and gritty crime drama.

I‚Äôve watched many gangster movies and and I can‚Äôt understand why so many think it‚Äôs a classic. It‚Äôs filled with tired clich√©s of the genre, the acting, storyline and plot are rather weak. The photography and lighting are so bad you need to squint to see most of the scenes. The way the movie ends with that ‚Äúeveryone gets hit by a bus, then end‚Äù styles ending tells me the writers ran out of already weak ideas and decided to take an easy way out.

i loved this movie. i watched it in Spain, as a teenager, during the time we were learning about 'la Guerra Civil'. It helped me understand so much better what Spain has gone through. Marvelous acting, it will make you laugh but mostly cry at the injustice there was and still is in some places. Very moving story!

A minimalist action drama that reminds me of an Antonioni film in its ability to become slow-motion in pacing where the main character is absorbing in his lack of dialogue. Clearly something is going on and like reading a novel each new page brings you deeper into the plot. A sad troubled film that as the title Fireworks implies is a caldron an alchemical spewing of heat and sparks up to the last frame. Brilliant!!

I've been watching and rewatching this film for decades. It is a beautifully plotted thriller - not fast but compelling - and a memorable portrait of Manhattan. I particularly love the gaslit paranoia that isolates the main character, progressively and seemingly irreversibly, like a bug in a spider's web. As such it is a moral fable about an individual fighting social death.

It is implausible but it impacts and stirs up mixed feelings that certainly does not leave you indifferent, so atrocious with a vulgar and disturbing comic perspective but it captivates you with a surreal and perverse reality in the area in which it moves... it is certainly worth seeing. . Thank you Almod√≥var, a Bolivian in Madrid thanks you.

I had a great time reviewing Kika with those very Almodovarian plots, that Forqu√© unleashed, that April victory, the current transcript of a Maria Pati√±o, even Peter Coyote is splendid. That we miss Almodovar who did not bow to what was politically correct and nauseating.

Alternatively, the James character played by John Hannah is particularly endearing; I think we are all rooting for this version to survive.

It gives the answer to the question ""What if"" and also shows that if it is destined no matter what path you take, it will still lead to that scenario.

Excruciating, eye roll inducing clap trap. Paltrow's 'English' accent aside, proof that even the best actors (Hannah, Lynch) can't create fully formed characters from a dire script. Both the male leads play hand wringing apologists who you'd just like to sock in the jaw, if only you cared enough to do so. Paltrow's Helen, about as interesting as grey rice pudding, may well make you feel robbed of the two hours you invested in this film, only for her to forget the Highway Code and *SPOILER ALERT* ...MORE

It's very similar to that flick, Plan 9 from Outer Space by Ed Wood.

But, I don't know... Her latest performance in the Goop Lab was exactly the same... extremely flat. I mean, she was playing herself.

How do you train for this? How do you work as a performer and manage to act in the same way since 1989? Is there a school for this type of method acting?
